Caching Murphi Release 5.4.9.1
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.4.9.1 is based on various versions of Murphi.

Murphi release 3.1 :

Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./moesi

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 16 bits (rounded up to 8 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  8 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 476219 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 47621 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.
State 1:
a[NODE_1]:I
a[NODE_2]:I

State 2:
a[NODE_1]:E
a[NODE_2]:I

State 3:
a[NODE_1]:S
a[NODE_2]:I

State 4:
a[NODE_1]:S
a[NODE_2]:S

State 5:
a[NODE_1]:M
a[NODE_2]:I

State 6:
a[NODE_1]:OSTATUS
a[NODE_2]:S


==========================================================================

Status:

	No error found.

State Space Explored:

	6 states, 16 rules fired in 0.10s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
